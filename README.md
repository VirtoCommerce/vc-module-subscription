## Recurring order scenario
1. Customer adds products to cart and proceeds to checkout
2. Customer selects "I want this to be a recurring order" option
3. Customer sets the recurrence parameters
4. Customer proceeds with the checkout and submits the order
5. System creates both the order and a subscription based on that order
6. System background job periodically checks existing subscriptions and generates new orders (if needed)
7. System sends email notification to the customer about the new order
8. Customer receives the email and clicks the link to open the order in storefront
9. a) Customer reviews the order and confirms payment
9. b) Alternatively, customer opens the associated subscription and cancels it. No more new orders would be generated for this subscription ever again.

### Subscription scenario
1. Customer Service Representative (CSR) creates a new product and defines auto-order schedule for it.
2. Customer orders such product as usual. Note: there will be no possibility to select "I want this to be a recurring order" during checkout.
3. The remaining steps are identical to the ones in "Recurring order scenario" starting from step 5.

### Data flows

Subscriptions are used for generating new Orders under some rules. That is why we always store 2 entities: Subscription and associated Order. The latter we call a "prototype Order" as future Orders will be generated from it.

* When a Customer creates an Order in storefront, it's sent to Orders service;
* Orders service saves the Customer Order to database and also fires OrderChangeEvent even;
* Subscription module receives OrderChangeEvent (containing the Order).
    * If this was a newly created Order with associated payment plan (and not a prototype for some Subscription), then:
    	1. Create new Subscription;
    	2. Clone given Order and associate it with the new Subscription.
    * If the received Order was generated by a Subscription, then the Subscription should be updated (status, balance recalculated, etc.). This includes the scenario when new Order was generated by Process Subscription Job.
* Scheduled job initiates Subscription processing periodically. It reads active Subscriptions from database and generates new Orders (if needed).
